CLOCK MODULE

Generates an array of 3-pairs representing the RGB value of neopixels
to represent a clock

Values for the different parts of the clock pixels can be provided,
if they are not provided then default values are used

Colour values can also be changed while the CLOCK MODULE is running.



TODO:
- Create pixel generation
- Create colour change functions
- Create callback for the values
- Allow UTC offsets to be provided

long term
- Work with queue-dequeue
- figure out how to get pre-generated clock values to work with an appropriate interrupt to indicate the change of values.
